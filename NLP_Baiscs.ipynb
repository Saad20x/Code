PTI boycotted the 2008 election, but in the subsequent election, became the second-largest party by popular vote.[14][15] In the 2018 general election, running on a populist platform, PTI emerged as the largest party in the National Assembly, and formed a coalition government with independents with Khan as Prime Minister.\n",
